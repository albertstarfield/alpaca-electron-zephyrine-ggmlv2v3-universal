- [x] Multi-LLMChild Background Queue Prompt to Experience when can't catch up with QoS time (Improving experience 100B Parameter Adelaide Paradigm Experience) (Backbrain).
- [x] Implementing ms QoS for LLMChild to prevent unecessary Lock-up Implementing a Proactive Lockup Timeout Verification Mechanism in the Quest for External Context Acquisition.
- [x] Developing Workaround for the Adelaide Paradigm Achilles Heel, v8 4GB memory enforced limit by electron. (v8 pointer compression memory heap limitation) (--max-old-space-size=1342177280 Bumping up the size to 1TB) There is no such thing as overkill.
- [x] Implemented UMA MLCMCF "Bigger" context window manager LLM Agnostic design.
- [x] Implement and Replace Context Depth fetching to MLCMCF (Multi Level Condensed Memory Contextual Fetching).
- [x] Facilitates access to local literature documents and resources through local files integration, excluding formatted documents, Implemented using UMA MLCMCF NLP Based matching.
- [x] New JSON interaction database that handles emotion sentiment analysis, more data, side of interaction, and multiple SessionID
- [x] Multi-submission input lifelike input rather than flip-flop wait for response type of classic interaction.
- [x] Interaction Experience UMA MLCMCF Sideloading Subsystem.
